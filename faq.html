        <summary >What is Matcha?</summary>
        <p id="what1">Matcha is finely ground green tea leaf traditionally consumed to boost energy and promote focus. Unlike other teas where you are drinking only an extract, with matcha the entire leaf is consumed to provide not only caffeine but a whole cup of amino acids, nutrients, and chlorophyll. Energy without the crash, focus without the jitters.

        <h5>Fueled by Volcanoes</h5>
        <p>Our founders were first introduced to this mineral rich distinctively tasting matcha by Max’s family in Japan. The Ando’s purchased their tea’s from this region, known for the fertile soils packed with higher levels of nitrogen. Still to this day it is one of Kyushu’s best kept secrets.</p>
